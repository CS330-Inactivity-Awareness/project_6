# How to begin development

## Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/CS330-Inactivity-Awareness/project_6.git
```

## Install nodejs

Download and install node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (This will also install npm)


## Installing necessary node packages
While in the project directory, run the following commands:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

```
npm install
```

## Download the Expo App

The Expo app allows you to rapidly test your code as you make changes to it. When running the Expo server on your computer and connecting your phone to it through the Expo app, you'll be able to make changes to your app and see those changes realtime on your phone.


## Start Development

Run the command:
```
expo start
```

This should open up a browser on your computer with a QR code. Scan the code with Expo app on your phone. This will download and open up your app.


## Develop

Now that you have the app on your phone and the expo running, go ahead and update the code and as you save your changes the app should automatically update.
